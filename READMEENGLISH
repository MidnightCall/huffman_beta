This program is only used to write binary tree data structures in C++, C++ IO streams
The study cannot be used for file compression for engineering requirements

Expected Objectives:
1. Implement compressed âˆš of text files
2. Implement compression of binary stream files
3. Use graphical interface design to create a friendly interactive environment

Goal 1 is achieved, but Huffman encoding is not converted into a byte stream to write to a file, resulting in uncompressed use

2022 / 11 / 110
Considering the recent business, habits, software requirements analysis, data structure
and other courses require midterm exams, and the implementation of functions 2 and 3 is suspended, and will be later
Further development continues
